# Evolution Simulation Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features and milestones for the Evolution Simulation project. It is subject to change based on feedback and project requirements.

## Milestone 0: Basic Simulation Setup

- [x] Implement basic grid-based simulation environment.
- [x] Integrate animal movement, consumption, and energy management.
- [x] Add plant entities for energy replenishment.
- [x] Implement basic DNA system for animals.

## Milestone 0.1: Expansion of Organisms DNA attributes

- [ ] Creating a DNA class to hold information about an organism.
- [ ] Adding new attributes to the DNA class.
- [ ] Implement effects of attributes on animals properties.
- [ ] Enable mutation of DNA during reproduction.

## Milestone 1: Organism Database

- [x] Create a database with all organisms that have existed / exist in the simulation.
- [x] Enable automatic saving of organisms to the database
- [x] Track different statistics about the life of the organism like a movement heatmap, kills, etc.

## Milestone 2: Organism Database interaction

- [ ] Enable querying of the database.
- [ ] Enable filtering of the database.

## Milestone 3: Visualization and Genetic Analysis

- [ ] Visualize gene distribution in the simulation.
- [ ] Implement a panel displaying graphs and visualizations of gene distribution.
- [ ] Analyze statistics such as lifespan and offspring production.

## Milestone 4: User Interaction and GUI Improvements

- [ ] Develop a user-friendly GUI for simulation settings adjustment.
- [ ] Enable users to view an animal's statistics and DNA attributes by clicking on them.

## Milestone 5: Neural Networks

- [ ] Integrate neural networks for animal behavior.
- [ ] Enable NN mutatinos for offspring.
- [ ] Enable visualisation and comparision of NN's
- [ ] Implement speciation.

## Milestone 6: Performance improvement

- [ ] Improve datatypes and structure to improve performance.
- [ ] Rethink usage of the grid and tile structure and if it can be improved.

## Milestone 7: World improvement

- [ ] Implement an infinite world with a chunking system.
- [ ] Allow the traversing of the world.
- [ ] Add biome types.
- [ ] Implement day and night cycle influencing the organisms and world.
- [ ] Improve weather and environement simulation. (optional)

## Milestone 8: Animal improvements

- [ ] Enable different types of sight. (for example color based)
- [ ] Enable pheromone expulsion and sensing.
- [ ] Enabling sound and hearing.

## Milestone 9: Reproduction improvements

- [ ] Implement differten reproduction types such as sexual reproduction mechanics.
- [ ] Add incubation time for female animals, impacting offspring development.
- [ ] Implement reproductive urge and attraction mechanics.

## Milestone 10: Plant expansion

- [ ] Expand possibilities of different types of plants.
- [ ] Expand plant dna attributes
- [ ] Enable plants to play a more active role in shaping the simulation

## Milestone 11: Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components.
- [ ] Create detailed documentation for the project.
- [ ] Refine README.md with setup instructions and project overview.

## Milestone 12: Finalization and Optimization

- [ ] Polish user interface and experience.
- [ ] Optimize code for performance.
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing and debugging.
